#Basic Financial Dashboard using next.js, React.js, Vercel, TailWind and Postgresql

## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.


To start next.js for financial dashboard using default template

npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"

This command uses create-next-app, a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that sets up a Next.js application for you. In the command above, you're also using the --example flag with the starter example for this course.

Folder structure
You'll notice that the project has the following folder structure:

/app: Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.

/app/lib: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.

/app/ui: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.

/public: Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.

/scripts: Contains a seeding script that you'll use to populate your database in a later chapter.

Config Files: You'll also notice config files such as next.config.js at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using create-next-app. You will not need to modify them in this course.
